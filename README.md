This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.5.

1- Install angular cli globally by running:

npm install -g @angular/cli

2- Install node packages by running:

npm i

Make sure you have latest LTS version of node and npm installed.

3- Run project on localhost by running:

ng serve -o

That's it. Happy codding :)

Note: Sass code is a little messed up, did n't used reusable classes and best practices. There may be some responsiveness issues as well. I had some important stuff at home so, could n't fix it.
I can surely fix these issues after the interview once you decide to take this recruitement process to a next level.
